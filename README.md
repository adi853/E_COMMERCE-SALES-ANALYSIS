## Analyzing 11 Months of Sales Trends using MySQL

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset containing **11 months of sales data** across 30+ product categories. Using **MySQL**, I extracted actionable insights regarding revenue trends, seasonality, and customer satisfaction to help drive data-driven business decisions.

## 🚀 Key Business Insights
* **Revenue Leaders:** The **BOOKS, SPORTS, TOYS, CLOTHING, and HEALTH** categories emerged as the primary revenue drivers.
* **Sales Seasonality:** Analysis revealed a significant sales peak in **Quarter 3**, suggesting a strong seasonal trend.
* **Quality Benchmark:** High-rated products (Review Score > 4.5) show a strong correlation with higher sales volume.

## 🛠️ SQL Skills Showcased
* **Data Aggregation:** Using `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT` for KPIs.
* **Advanced Logic:** Implementing `ANY_VALUE()` and `GROUP BY` for complex category analysis.
* **Arithmetic Calculations:** Creating calculated fields for total revenue and cumulative sales.
* **Seasonality Logic:** Segmenting data into Quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3) to identify growth patterns.

## 📊 Power BI Visualization
I have transformed the SQL-extracted data into an interactive dashboard to uncover deep business insights.
Interactive KPIs: Tracked Total Revenue, Order Quantity, Total Reviews, and Average Rating at a glance.
Revenue Segmentation: Analyzed revenue distribution across categories using Bar and Pie charts, identifying Books and Sports as top earners.
Quality vs Popularity: Implemented a Combo Chart to correlate Average Rating (Quality) with Review Count (Popularity) across categories.
User Interactivity: Added Category Slicers and dynamic filters to allow real-time data exploration.
Design & UX: Utilized a clean, modern layout with consistent color palettes and layering for a professional user experience.

## 🚀 Key Insights from Dashboard
Revenue Drivers: The Books category is the leading contributor to total revenue.
Quality Gaps: Identified categories with high sales volume but lower average ratings, indicating areas for product improvement.
Customer Engagement: High review counts in specific categories suggest strong customer interest and engagement.
